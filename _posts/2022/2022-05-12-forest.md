title:  "The Forest"
teaser: "Collage is a medium that allows you to mix different realities. I’ve always been enchanted by the forest and think that it’s a place where anything can be found. Through this digital collage, I incorporated cutouts from a various array of magazines, with the hope of portraying an ambience that is confusing but enticing at the same time. The forest is magical! There is so much hidden in the spaces of nature we transit through. "
