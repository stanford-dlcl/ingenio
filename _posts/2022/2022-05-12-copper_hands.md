Your copper hands dozing off on the sheets.<br />
I saw them then. I see them now. <br />
Your nails, glossy red polish, always impeccably filed. <br />
No smears, crossovers, nor chips. <br />
Strong hands, kind hands always at work,  <br />
Scribbling legal opinions at dawn, <br />
Stacking lunch boxes next, <br />
Rubbing my angry belly. I used to be your drum. <br />
No wrinkles just yet. <br />
Only the pipelines of your maritime strength. <br />
All your body a tender stump laid down,<br />
yellowing, but beautiful still. <br />

Your thighs, <br />
(La cuerpa – says Luisa) <br />
Sensual at the knees, glimmering from the oils you rubbed with diligence <br />
After the daily downpour. <br />
Your feet, over-fed half-moons to me so rebellious. So indifferent to your bureaucratic elegance. <br />
Your breasts, I saw those, too.  <br />
Every morning, sagging lightly  <br />
Above your generous belly, your Chinese navel. <br />
Your belly the same for twenty-five years. <br />
An achievement of womanhood. Impossible. <br />
Time stops at your belly. <br />
An ageless adulthood you briskly perfumed, panty-hosed, and high-heeled. <br />
Always knowing. <br />
Always leaving the house at the same godless hour. <br />
Always waking to the same ring. 
 
And though time is running out for me  <br />
And I don’t understand this ride,  <br />
Nor wish to be in it—Frankly— <br />
You are still life full. Even when dead. <br />
And when you went into the furnace, <br />
Clad with your medals, your iron reputation, <br />
Your face a canvas I had carefully splotched  <br />
The friar wig (I did my best), <br />
Surrounded by those whom you <br />
With resolution <br />
Tried to shepherd out of incompetence <br />
Sometimes with an electric prod <br />
I could still see  <br />
The hands, the thighs, the breasts, the belly, Even the graying groin, Always the same. <br />
Always here.
