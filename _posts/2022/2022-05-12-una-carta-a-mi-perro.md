title:  "Una carta a mi perro"
teaser: 'This comic is a letter to my dog Tessie, who was very old and sick when I was making this piece in the Spring of 2021 and who has since passed away. I spent many months grieving her while she was still alive and many months after her death struggling to process her loss in a world stricken with death from COVID-19. This comic is everything I wanted to tell her during that time – my worries, regrets, and of course my love for her.'
