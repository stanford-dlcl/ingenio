This illustration describes the internal conflict of my Argentine roots while residing in the US, feeling connected to both places but never enough for either. I grew up in New York, but my father was determined for me to be part of Argentina, a way to keep his home close by. I spent years going to Argentine school, with my life full of traditions that only existed in certain places, hidden from my peers at my normal school. Symbolizing the division between these identities, the face is swarmed by a confusing tornado of elements of cultural significance. The pieces are all-encompassing, but slightly out of reach.
