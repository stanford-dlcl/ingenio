teaser: '"A Conversation between Insomniacs" is a sci-fi screenplay centered around themes of identity and mortality. After an unnamed apocalypse, all remaining humans emigrate from Earth, leaving behind uploaded minds to work on making the Earth's biosphere habitable again.

The screenplay follows the encounter between one particular uploaded mind and the part-alien descendants of his original human self, as they comb through the memories of this human and reflect on their respective identities.'
